We will be implementing a Skier-Routing app. 

/*
Many of the modern ski areas are widespread with dozens of chair-lifts/gondolas, sometimes up-to hundreds of kilometres of ski slopes and many dining establishments. 
The app will help the avid skier to find the best way to get from point A to a point B. 
The slopes are of different difficulty (blue, red and black) and the skier, depending on confidence/ability level, should be able to specify which slopes to use. 
In a normal situation, moving up will involve lifts and the skiers will ski down the slope. But in some cases, the skier may decide to take the lift down 
(e.g., if the only available slope is a challenging black one). The app should also help the skier to find the right food place and public restrooms.

The app will determine the location of the skier. The Web-based app, should be targeted towards mobile phone. 

Here is a link to one of the ski areas in the European Alps.
